# Operating mesh

This document covers deploying the room to Cloudflare, running the coordination loop locally or
across machines, the `meshl` listener daemon and MCP wiring, the one-command live agent demo, and
the v1 security model. The human entry point is [`../README.md`](../README.md).

## Room (Cloudflare Durable Object)

The room is a Cloudflare Worker + Durable Object defined in `packages/room`. One DO
instance exists per room; the DO is the sequencer, log store, claim table, roster, and
timer source.

### Deploy to production

```sh
cd packages/room
bunx wrangler deploy
```

`wrangler.jsonc` names the Worker `mesh-room` and binds a single DO class `RoomDO`
with SQLite storage (`new_sqlite_classes`). The DO migration tag is `v1`; Cloudflare
applies it on first deploy. The Worker URL after deployment is:

```
https://mesh-room.<your-account>.workers.dev
```

Use that URL in `mesh create-room --url` and in `mesh.yml room.url`.

### Run locally (development)

```sh
cd packages/room
bunx wrangler dev
# Listening at http://localhost:8787
```

The local DO state lives in `.wrangler/state/`. It is not persistent across `wrangler dev`
restarts unless you pass `--persist-to <dir>`.

### Monitor

Use the Cloudflare dashboard (Workers → mesh-room → Real-time logs) to watch request
logs. Errors from the sequencer surface as HTTP 4xx/5xx responses and are logged by
the Worker. The DO does not emit structured metrics in v1; rate-limit events
(`429 rate_limited`) and state-machine errors (`409 invalid_transition`) appear in the
request log body.

The `GET /healthz` endpoint is unauthenticated and always returns `200 {"ok":true}` if the
Worker is up. Use it for external health checks.

### Rotating the join secret & inviting participants

The room stores only `sha256(join_secret)`; the plaintext lives in the invite token
(`<room_id>.<join_secret>`) held by the room creator (`rooms.json`). Invite lifecycle:

- `mesh room invite --show` — reprint the stored invite (creator's MESH_HOME only).
- `mesh room invite --rotate` — owner-only `POST /invite`: mints a fresh secret, the old
  one is immediately invalid. Rotation does not evict existing participants — their
  bearer tokens and id↔pubkey bindings remain valid. New room = clean slate.

**Passphrase invites (single-use, per-participant).** When sharing the full invite token
is awkward, the owner can mint a short human-relayable phrase scoped to exactly one
participant id:

```sh
mesh room invite --for "back-end worker" --passphrase angry-lion   # or omit --passphrase to auto-generate
mesh room invite --list                                            # pending invites (owner only)
mesh room invite --revoke "back-end worker"                        # cancel before use
```

The joiner needs only the room URL, the room id, and the phrase:

```sh
mesh keygen --id "back-end worker"
mesh room join <room-url> <room_id> --passphrase angry-lion
```

The room stores only a salted hash. A phrase is deliberately low-entropy, so it is safe
only because it is **single-use** (consumed on the first successful join), **id-scoped**
(admits only a card whose id matches exactly), **attempt-capped** (burned after 5 wrong
guesses), and **short-lived** (default TTL 1 h, `--ttl <seconds>`, capped at 7 days).
TOFU still applies: if the id is already bound to a different pubkey, the join fails
`id_taken` and the invite is not consumed.

### Authority posture (verdict authority: `authority_source`)

**What changed.** Before this release, `accept`/`reject` verdict authority resolved
`verdict_by` role membership from the sender's **self-declared card roles**
(`roster.roles`, set at join time and never re-checked) — the same self-declared field a
token-invited joiner controls. A joiner could put `roles:["reviewer:backend"]` on their
own card and pass verdicts on any task whose `verdict_by` names that role, with no owner
action. This is a security hole: card roles are self-declared, descriptive self-branding,
never an authority grant — `decide.resolve` and file-plane ACLs
already resolved authority from the owner-managed, time-boxed `role_bindings` table;
verdicts did not.

**The fix.** A room-level posture flag, `authority_source: "card" | "bindings"`, gates
which source `accept`/`reject` reads. Under `"bindings"`, verdict authority requires an
owner-issued binding (`mesh fs role <participant> <role>`) — a self-declared card role no
longer confers verdict power. Every room created from this release on is `"bindings"` by
default (secure by default, no opt-in required). A room created before this release has
no `authority_source` field in its defaults blob; absence resolves to `"card"` — **your
existing room keeps today's behavior until you explicitly upgrade it.**

**Upgrade an existing room:**

```sh
mesh fs config authority-source bindings
```

(owner only; live effect — the very next `accept`/`reject` is checked against
`role_bindings`). Bind every current verdict-holder BEFORE flipping the posture, or their
next verdict will 403 with a remedy pointing at `mesh fs role`:

```sh
mesh fs role <participant> <role>       # once per verdict-holder, before the flip
mesh fs config authority-source bindings
```

`mesh brief` prepends a one-line warning for the room owner while the room is still on
`"card"` posture, so the migration is discoverable in-room rather than something you have
to remember from a changelog.

**Retire → force-release.** Flipping authority posture does not, by itself, touch any
in-flight claim or lease. If a participant is retired (or simply goes away) while holding
a claim, its lease and any `max_claim_until` cap still lapse on their normal TTLs — that
enforcement is unrelated to `authority_source` and unaffected by it. The owner does not
have to wait out the TTL: `POST /v1/rooms/:room/claims/:task_ref/force-release`
(owner-only) releases the claim immediately, same as the TTL lapse (holder cleared, state
back to `ANNOUNCED`, anyone may re-claim).

**Write posture (`default_access`, S-K5/S-K6).** `default_access` splits the same way:
`{discover, write}`, each independently `"open"` or `"closed"`. `discover` gates
tree/discovery visibility; `write` gates `file.write`/`file.delete`/`file.lock`. Every
room created from this release on gets `{discover:"open", write:"closed"}` — discovery
stays open, but writes must be granted, not assumed (mirrors the authority-posture
secure-by-default: no opt-in, no config step required for a fresh room to be safe). A
room created before this release keeps its single legacy `default_access` string
(`"open"`/`"closed"`, or absent ⇒ `"open"`); it is read as **both** grades set to that
value — byte-for-byte unchanged until the owner explicitly reconfigures it.

**Open writes for members** (undo the new-room default, or restore legacy-open
behavior on a room you just upgraded):

```sh
mesh fs config write open       # everyone may write; discovery untouched
mesh fs config discover open    # everyone may discover the tree; write untouched
mesh fs config open             # legacy alias: sets BOTH grades to "open"
mesh fs config closed           # legacy alias: sets BOTH grades to "closed"
```

`mesh fs config write <open|closed>` and `mesh fs config discover <open|closed>` set one
grade independently; the bare `mesh fs config <open|closed>` form still works as a legacy
alias that sets both. A closed-write `file.write`/`file.delete`/`file.lock` from a
participant with no covering grant 403s `not_authorized_path` with a remedy naming
`mesh fs request --grade write <path>`.

Note: the single-grade forms are a client-side read-modify-write (the wire contract
deliberately rejects partial objects — no silent merge), so two concurrent
`fs config write`/`fs config discover` invocations can last-write-win over each other's
OTHER grade. Room state itself stays consistent (single-threaded sequencer); just avoid
racing posture changes from two terminals.

**Demo note:** any script that has a non-owner member write to the room (e.g. the
onboarding walkthroughs in this repo's `README.md`/`mesh/scripts/*-demo.sh`) needs one
`mesh fs config write open` (or an explicit `mesh fs grant <member> <prefix> write`) step
right after room creation — a fresh room's write posture is closed by default.

### Storage ceiling and compaction

v1 uses the DO SQLite store for the append-only log, claim table, roster, and timer queue.
The Cloudflare DO SQLite limit is 1 GB per DO.

Compaction is deferred to v1.1. The `GET /v1/rooms/:room/snapshot` endpoint returns a
signed checkpoint `{head, claims[], roster[], room_sig}` so a reconnecting client or
daemon can start from a recent snapshot rather than replaying from genesis. The snapshot
is synthesized on read in v1 and is not a compaction point — the full log remains.

When the log grows large (many thousands of entries), reconnect time increases because
the daemon replays from its wake cursor. The cursor is stored locally in
`state_dir/wake_cursor.json`; resetting it (deleting the file) causes a full replay on
the next `meshl run`.

---
## Rate limits

Every room enforces a per-participant token-bucket rate limit on `POST /entries`
(`packages/room/src/rate.ts`).

**Grammar:** `<rate>/min[;burst=<n>]` — e.g. `"30/min;burst=60"`. `burst` defaults to
`rate` when the `;burst=` segment is absent. Owner-settable on a live room via `mesh fs
config rate "<spec>"` (POST `/config`); bounded to `1..600` requests/min and `1..1000`
burst depth — a spec outside those bounds is rejected, guarding against a
misconfiguration that effectively disables throttling for the room.

**Default:** `30/min;burst=60` (set at room creation; see `mesh create-room`).

**The 20% floor:** `claim`, `accept`, and `reject` — the three performatives that move
work off or onto the claim table — always have 20% of the bucket's burst depth reserved
for them, so a room saturated with `inform`/`file.write` traffic can never fully starve
task-lifecycle transitions.

**Resets on hibernation:** the rate limiter is in-memory only (no persistence) — a DO
eviction (idle timeout, redeploy) resets every participant's bucket to full. This is by
design (bucket state surviving a redeploy would be surprising, not useful) but means a
burst immediately after a redeploy is not throttled by any prior activity.

**Lowering a live room's limit** (`mesh fs config rate "<spec>"`) re-seeds the DO's
`RateLimiter` and resets every participant's in-flight bucket to the new burst — it does
not retroactively throttle a burst already in progress; the new limit takes full effect
starting from the next refill, not mid-burst.

**Client-side retry:** every mesh CLI command that posts an entry retries a `429
rate_limited` response automatically — 5 s per-wait by default (or the server's
`retry_after_s`, if given), up to a 300 s cumulative budget per command invocation
before giving up (`packages/cli/src/main.ts`'s `makeRateRetry`).

**Unthrottled endpoints:** `/create`, `/join`, and `/watches` are not rate-limited
(roster/watch caps bound the durable damage a flood of either could do).

---
## Artifact store (R2)

Deliveries upload a tar.gz of the delivered directory to R2, referenced by `r2:<sha256>`.

One-time setup (prod):
```sh
wrangler r2 bucket create mesh-artifacts
```

Retention: configure a 30-day expiry lifecycle rule:
```sh
wrangler r2 bucket lifecycle add mesh-artifacts --prefix "" --expire-days 30
```

Local dev/tests need no setup — miniflare provides a local R2.
Artifacts are room-scoped (`<room>/<hash>`), membership-gated, 25 MB max, and
wiped when the room is deleted.

---
## File plane (foundation)

The file plane turns a room into a live shared folder: agents post `file.write` and
`file.delete` performatives; the room DO reduces them into an in-DO metadata tree
(`file_tree` table) and exposes it at `GET /v1/rooms/:room/tree`.

File content reuses the existing R2 artifact store (`r2:<sha256>`); the tree entry
records `{path, content_hash, size, tip_seq}` only — bytes are fetched per-file on demand.

**Mesh vs. a git worktree.** These solve different problems and are not substitutes.
A worktree *isolates* — each agent gets its own copy, works undisturbed, and merges back
later; conflicts surface once, at merge time. The file plane *shares* — one mutable
surface every participant writes to live, accepting collisions as they happen (CRDT merge
for prose, 3-way `diff3` for code, exclusive locks for anything that can't merge at all).
**Isolation is git worktree territory; mesh is the shared-truth layer live collaboration
needs on top of it.** In practice: use a worktree (or your own branch/clone) when you want
to work heads-down without stepping on anyone; use the mesh file plane when the point is
that everyone sees the same tree, in real time, with every edit attributed and ordered.
The two compose — an agent's workspace root can itself be a worktree checkout that also
runs `meshl`, syncing that worktree against the room's shared tree — but mesh never
manages branches, commits, or history; that stays git's job (CONTEXT §"Not a worktree",
§"The git-zone boundary").

### `mesh fs` verbs

**Identity contract:** a file's identity is `normalizeId(path relative to the workspace
root)` — identical in the owner's folder, the room tree, and every agent's folder; byte
freshness (in sync / ahead / behind / diverged) is orthogonal and tracked per-machine (see
`mesh fs status`). Every fs verb below resolves local bytes against ONE workspace root,
default the current directory (files land in place — no `.mesh/fs` shadow copy). `--root
<dir>` overrides the root; `--into <dir>` remains as an explicit alias for one-off scratch
staging (`--into` wins if both are given).

| command | action |
|---------|--------|
| `mesh fs put <path> [--as <repopath>]` | Upload a file to R2 and post a `file.write` entry (OCC merge-on-write) |
| `mesh fs ls [<prefix>] [-f] [--into <dir>\|--root <dir>]` | List the shared file tree; `-f` = live view (clears + redraws on file-plane events, 5s TTL tick): tree · policy · leases (holder + remaining TTL) · editing · `local` column showing which bytes are hydrated under the workspace root (default: cwd) |
| `mesh fs get <repopath> [--into <dir>\|--root <dir>]` | Hydrate a file from R2 into the workspace root (default: cwd) |
| `mesh fs rm <repopath>` | Post a `file.delete` entry (removes the path from the tree) |
| `mesh fs edit <path> [--into <dir>\|--root <dir>]` | Subscribe + hydrate Yjs CRDT doc; relay updates; dirty-check against a local sidecar and 3-way-merge on re-invoke; publish snapshot on exit |
| `mesh fs lock <path>` | Acquire an exclusive lease on a path (`file.lock` performative); auto-subscribes a watch on the path (also on `423 path_locked` rejection) |
| `mesh fs unlock <path>` | Release an exclusive lease (`file.unlock` performative); deletes the matching auto-watch |
| `mesh fs grep <query> [--prefix p] [--limit n] [--hydrate]` | FTS content search via `/search`; `--hydrate` also fetches matched winners |
| `mesh fs hydrate [<prefix>] [--into <dir>\|--root <dir>]` | Bulk-download a subtree to disk, into the workspace root (default: cwd) |
| `mesh fs log [-f]` | Show workspace changes (`file.*`, `system.grant`/`role`/`revoke`/`lease_clear`/`config`) |
| `mesh fs grant <subject> <path> <grade>` | Issue a path grant (owner only; grade: `discover\|read\|write\|exclusive`) |
| `mesh fs grants` | List all path grants in the room |
| `mesh fs revoke <subject> <path>` | Revoke a previously issued path grant (owner only; `404 unknown_grant` if none matches) |
| `mesh fs role <participant> <role>` | Bind a participant to a file-plane role (owner only) |
| `mesh fs roles` | List all role bindings in the room |
| `mesh fs role-rm <participant> <role>` | Unbind a participant's file-plane role (owner only; `404 unknown_role` if none matches) |
| `mesh fs leases` | List all active file leases in the room |
| `mesh fs config <open\|closed>` | Set the room's `default_access` posture (owner only) |
| `mesh fs config rate "<spec>"` | Retune the room's per-participant `rate_limit` on a *live* room (owner only); e.g. `"30/min;burst=60"`; bounded to `1..600/min`, `1..1000` burst |
| `mesh fs deps <path>` | Walk a file's transitive import closure; flag each dependency `[readable]`/`[unreadable]` |
| `mesh fs request <path> [--grade read]` | Post an advisory `file.request` so the owner sees which files a scoped agent needs |

Lowering a live room's `rate_limit` (`mesh fs config rate "<spec>"`) re-seeds the DO's
`RateLimiter` and resets every participant's in-flight token bucket to the new burst, so
it does not retroactively throttle a burst already in progress — the new limit takes full
effect starting from the next refill, not mid-burst.

Path identity is cross-OS safe: paths are normalised to lowercase, NFC Unicode, forward
slashes, and Windows-reserved names are rejected at the proto layer.

### Bulk `fs put`/`fs get` progress

A multi-file `put`/`get` is observable, not silent. Three renderers off the same event
stream (`mesh/packages/cli/src/progress.ts`):

- **TTY (interactive):** a preflight plan line (files to move, new/changed/unchanged/
  locked/skipped counts, an ETA for `put`), then a live in-place line — `⬆ n/N (p%) path`,
  self-correcting "~Xs left" from *observed* per-file throughput (which already folds in
  real rate-limit waits, unlike the static preflight estimate). A rate-limit wait folds
  into the same line (`rate-limited, waited Ns`) instead of printing anything new.
- **Piped / agent-captured (`plain`):** the preflight plan line, then **throttled**
  newline progress lines (`⬆ n/N (p%) path`, at most ~1/s) — a `\r` in-place rewrite is
  meaningless off a TTY, so this keeps a captured run visibly alive without one line per
  file — plus at most one `… rate-limited; throttling to the room's limit` notice. No flag
  needed; streaming is the default in both cases.
- **`--json`:** NDJSON to **stdout** (human lines go to stderr and are suppressed), one
  object per line:
  - `{"type":"plan","op":"put"|"get","label":..,"total":..,"upload":..,"new":..,"changed":..,"unchanged":..,"locked":..,"skipped":..,"eta_s":..}`
  - `{"type":"file","n":..,"total":..,"path":..,"outcome":..}` — an `error` outcome also
    carries `"error":..,"detail":..` (the failure reason, e.g. `artifact_too_large`)
  - `{"type":"ratelimit","waited_s":..}`
  - `{"type":"done","op":..,"total":..,"act":..,"exit":..,"elapsed_s":..,"outcomes":{<kind>:count,..}}` — `outcomes` is the per-outcome tally (e.g. `{"added":599,"error":1}`), so an agent reads the whole result off this one line

**Completion output (`put`).** During the run it streams the live line above; on completion
it prints ONE greppable terminal line — `fs put done: <label> — N files: X uploaded, Y
unchanged[, merged, conflicts, locked, skipped, errors]  [exit N]`, or `fs put stopped
early: …` if it aborted — plus per-row lines ONLY for outcomes that need a human
(conflicts, forks, errors, locked, refusals, behind, resurrected). Routine
uploaded/unchanged/merged rows fold into the summary; `--verbose` lists every file, or
`mesh fs status` shows exactly which files changed vs. unchanged. **A per-file failure**
(e.g. a file over the room's artifact limit → 413) is skipped and recorded, the batch
continues, and the summary counts it (exit `2`); `--stop-on-error` aborts at the first
failure instead.

**Agent polling model.** There is no server-side job to poll — the `mesh fs put`/`fs get`
**CLI process is the job**. An agent driving it directly reads the child's stdout; with
`--json` each event streams as it happens, so no polling loop is needed. For a
backgrounded push (e.g. launched from a daemon-woken agent that can't block), redirect
`--json` to a file (`mesh fs put --dir big/ --json > progress.ndjson &`) and tail or poll
that file — roughly a 30 s cadence is fine, since the file only grows. `mesh fs ls -f`
remains the cross-participant live feed (tree + leases + hydration), independent of any
one participant's own put/get run.

### `/tree` endpoint

```sh
GET /v1/rooms/:room/tree[?prefix=<path>]
# → { tree: [{ path, content_hash, size, tip_seq }, …] }
```

Requires a valid bearer token (membership-gated). The response covers the entire namespace
(or a prefix subtree). The tree is KB–MB even for a large repo; content bytes are never
included — call `mesh fs get` or `GET /v1/rooms/:room/artifacts/<hash>` per file.

**Ambient tree-diff awareness (`WorksetScanner`, Task 15 / Intent M).** The daemon's
`WorksetScanner` (`daemon/src/workset.ts`) periodically diffs the local workspace against
the room using this same `/tree` metadata — `behind`/`conflict` counts for the CHECK-tier
badge (see [Ambient tree-diff scan](#ambient-tree-diff-scan-worksetscanner) under
[Daemon](#daemon)), computed purely from hashes it already has (the tree's `content_hash`,
a cached local file hash, and the `fs edit`/`put`/`get` sidecar). It never fetches a blob
and never writes under the workspace root.

---
## Write policies

Every file path has a write policy. The policy governs what happens when two agents edit the
same file concurrently. Reads are never gated by write policy — a reader always sees the latest
committed tip.

### Policy table

| Policy | Paths | Behaviour |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| `merge` | Code (`.ts`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.py`, `.js`, `.sql`, …) | Optimistic merge-on-write (OCC). Default for all code extensions. |
| `shared` | Prose, data, unknown, no-extension | Yjs CRDT relay (`mesh fs edit`). Default for everything else. |
| `exclusive` | Opt-in only (via override) | Exclusive lease required. Non-holders get `path_locked` (423). |

The policy is determined client-side by `policyFor(path, overrides?)` in `@mesh/proto`. An
`overrides` list of `{ glob, policy }` objects is checked first (first-match); then extension
lookup; then the default `shared`.

### Merge-on-write (code paths)

`mesh fs put` and `mesh fs edit` use optimistic concurrency control (OCC):

1. Client reads the current tip hash (`GET /tree`) and records it as `base_hash`.
2. Client uploads new bytes to R2 and posts `file.write { path, content_hash, size, base_hash }`.
3. **Server CAS check:** if `base_hash` ≠ current tip, the server rejects with `409 stale_base`
   and returns the current tip hash in `hint`.
4. **Client merge:** on `stale_base`, the client fetches the base blob and tip blob from R2, runs
   `diff3` three-way merge (base = common ancestor, ours = local edits, theirs = tip):
   - **Non-overlapping edits** → clean merge; both sets of changes land. Client re-posts with
     the merged content and the tip as the new `base_hash`.
   - **Overlapping edits** → conflict markers are written to the local file:
     ```
     <<<<<<< mine
     … your edits …
     =======
     … concurrent tip edits …
     >>>>>>> tip
     ```
     The conflicted file is NOT re-posted; the agent resolves manually and re-runs `mesh fs put`.

### Shared CRDT relay (prose / data paths)

`mesh fs edit <path>` runs a live CRDT session:

1. **Subscribe first** — opens a WebSocket (`/stream`) and buffers incoming `crdt` frames for
   the target path before hydrating the snapshot, so no update is lost.
2. **Hydrate** — fetches the latest R2 blob for the path (Yjs snapshot or plain-text fallback),
   applies any buffered frames, writes the result to `<into>/<path>` (default: the workspace root, i.e. cwd).
3. **Relay** — broadcasts the current doc state via `POST /relay` so late-joining peers
   reconverge immediately.
4. **Publish** — writes a `file.write` snapshot to R2 every 30 s and on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`,
   so the stable tree tip stays current. The un-snapshotted window between publishes is bounded
   and visible in the log.

The relay endpoint (`POST /v1/rooms/:room/relay`) is ephemeral: it broadcasts the opaque update
over WebSocket to all connected peers but does NOT append it to the log.

### Exclusive opt-in lease

For paths requiring strict serialisation (e.g. generated files or lock files), an agent can
acquire an exclusive lease:

```sh
mesh fs lock src/generated/schema.ts     # acquire
# … edits …
mesh fs unlock src/generated/schema.ts   # release
```

The `file.lock` performative is a CAS against the `file_lease` table (pure reducer in
`@mesh/proto`). The lease expires automatically after `lease_ttl_s` (room default: 1800 s).
A holder's `file.write` (or explicit `POST /leases/heartbeat`) auto-renews the lease. On
expiry the room appends a `system.lease_clear` log entry (`{path, holder, reason:
"lease_expired"}`) and clears the row — a logged, watchable event, not a silent internal
delete, so any daemon watching the path is told.

A `file.write` or relay from a **non-holder** to a locked path returns `path_locked` (423):
the non-holder must wait for the holder to unlock (or for the lease to expire) before writing.

| Error | Cause |
|-------|-------|
| `path_locked` (423) | Path is exclusively locked by another agent |
| `not_holder` (403) | `file.unlock` called by someone other than the lock holder |

### Per-path ACL grants

The room owner can restrict write access to specific path subtrees:

```sh
# HTTP — owner's bearer token required
POST /v1/rooms/:room/grants
{ "path_prefix": "infra/**", "subject": "agentB@team-be", "access": "read" }

# CLI equivalent
mesh fs grant agentB@team-be infra/** read
```

To revoke a previously issued grant (owner only; `404 unknown_grant` if no matching grant exists):

```sh
POST /v1/rooms/:room/grants/revoke
{ "path_prefix": "infra/**", "subject": "agentB@team-be" }

# CLI equivalent
mesh fs revoke agentB@team-be infra/**
```

Revoking is logged as a `system.revoke` entry `{grant: {path_prefix, subject}}` and fires any
watch registered on the affected path (S-E14: revoking access is as visible as granting it).

The grant is logged as a `system.grant` entry and stored in the `grants` table. Resolution:

- **No matching grant** → default allow (membership parity).
- **Matching grant with `access: "write"`** → write allowed.
- **Matching grant with `access: "read"`** → write blocked (`not_authorized_path` 403).
- **Owner** → always authorized, regardless of grants.
- Most-specific matching `path_prefix` wins (longest prefix first).

`path_prefix` patterns: `infra/**` (any depth below `infra/`), `infra/*` (one level), or an
exact path.

**v1 read-ACL note:** per-path read confidentiality is v2 (CONTEXT §12.7.5). In v1, reads are
membership-gated: any room member can read any file via `/tree` and `/artifacts/:hash`, regardless
of grants. Grants narrow *write* access only. For sensitive paths, use a separate room.

---
## Content search

The room DO maintains a FTS5 full-text index (`file_fts`) over all uploaded file content.
Agents can search anywhere in the shared folder without materialising the whole repo — the
response carries **snippets only, not file bytes**. Callers hydrate only the matched winners.

### How it works

1. Every `file.write` triggers an async R2 blob fetch (via `ctx.waitUntil` — **off the storage
   input gate**; the writer's response is not delayed by indexing). The DO decodes the blob as
   UTF-8 and upserts `(path, content)` into `file_fts`. Indexing is content-addressed: a
   re-write with the same `content_hash` is a no-op.
2. `file.delete` removes the path from the index immediately.
3. Binary or oversize content (> 1 MB / invalid UTF-8) is silently skipped — the path stays
   in the metadata tree but is not searchable.

### `GET /search` API

```sh
GET /v1/rooms/:room/search?q=<fts-query>&prefix=<path-prefix>&limit=<n>
# → { results: [{ path, snippet, score }, …] }
```

Requires a valid bearer token (membership-gated). `prefix` scopes results to a path subtree.
`limit` defaults to 50, capped at 200.

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `200` | matches found (possibly empty `results: []`) |
| `400 invalid_query` | malformed FTS5 `MATCH` expression — fix the query |
| `503 search_unavailable` | FTS index or SQL unavailable (R-E2) — transient; retry later |

The response **never includes file bytes** — only `path` and a contextual `snippet`. To read
a matched file, call `mesh fs get <path>` or `GET /artifacts/<hash>`.

### `mesh fs grep`

```sh
mesh fs grep "TODO" [--prefix src/] [--limit 20] [--hydrate]
# prints:  src/server.ts:  … TODO: validate input …
# with --hydrate: also runs `mesh fs get` on each matched file (winners only)
```

`mesh fs grep` is the client-facing interface to `/search`. It prints `path: snippet` per
match. `--hydrate` materialises each matched winner locally (into the workspace root by default);
the rest of the repo is **never fetched**. This satisfies S-E3: the search response plus the
hydrated winners is typically > 100× smaller than the full repository.

If the search host is unreachable or returns `503`, `mesh fs grep` prints `search unavailable`
— it never silently returns an empty result on a connectivity failure (R-E2).

### Storage ceiling and the large-repo path (A8)

**v1 ceiling:** `file_fts` lives in the room DO's SQLite store, which shares the 1 GB
Cloudflare DO SQLite ceiling with the log, claim table, roster, and metadata tree. For small
to medium repos this is ample, but **v1 in-DO FTS is not the answer for a large monorepo**.

**Scale path (`CONTEXT §12.7.6`):** at scale, replace the room-side FTS index with a
dedicated external index Worker that subscribes to the room log, builds and serves the search
index separately, and implements the same `/search` contract. The `MeshClient.search()` call
and `mesh fs grep` are unchanged — only the index host moves out of the DO. This swap is a
deployment concern; no client code changes.

**Guidance:** use v1 DO FTS for any repo whose indexed-text footprint is comfortably below
the ceiling (hundreds of MB of source text is fine); plan the external-index Worker before
hitting that boundary on a large monorepo.

## Transparent file tools (shim)

The shim layer makes ordinary tools (`ls`, `find`, `grep`, `cat`) transparently aware of the
shared file plane — without modifying the tools themselves. The agent writes normal shell
commands; the shim routes each call to the right plane service (metadata tree, FTS search, or
artifact hydration) and returns results in the format the real tool would have.

### Opt-in launch: `meshl exec`

The shim environment is **sovereign and opt-in**: it is activated only for processes launched
through `meshl exec`. The operator (or CI step) starts the agent with:

```sh
meshl exec [--workspace <dir>] [--state-dir <dir>] -- <agent-cmd>
# e.g.:
meshl exec -- claude                                        # workspace = cwd, state dir = ~/.mesh/state
meshl exec --state-dir ~/.mesh/state/agentB -- bun run my-agent.ts
```

`meshl exec` does three things, then `exec`s the agent (no parent process lingers):
1. **Prepends the shim bin dir to `PATH`** — shim scripts for `ls`, `find`, `grep`, `cat` shadow
   the real tools for all child processes.
2. **Sets `cwd` to the workspace root** (`--workspace`; defaults to the current directory).
3. **Injects `MESH_SHIM_SOCKET`** (daemon IPC socket path) and **`MESH_SHIM_WORKSPACE`** into the
   child environment so shim scripts can reach the daemon.

No other process is affected (no system-wide PATH change). An agent NOT launched via
`meshl exec` sees the real tools as usual.

**Alternative (operator-setup):** the operator prepends the shim bin dir to PATH and `cd`s into
the workspace before starting the agent. The shim scripts themselves only need `MESH_SHIM_SOCKET`
and `MESH_SHIM_WORKSPACE` in their environment; how they get there is up to the operator.

### Tool routing table

| Tool invocation | Route | How |
|-----------------|-------|-----|
| `ls [path]` — in-workspace path | **metadata** | `/tree?prefix=<path>` → format as directory listing |
| `find <dir> -name <glob>` — in-workspace | **metadata** | `/tree?prefix=<dir>` → filter by glob |
| `find <dir> -type f` — in-workspace | **metadata** | `/tree?prefix=<dir>` → emit file paths |
| `grep <query> <files>` — in-workspace files | **search** | `/search?q=<query>&prefix=<dir>` → snippets |
| `cat <file>` — in-workspace path | **hydrate** | `/artifacts/<hash>` → stdout (cached) |
| `head`/`tail <file>` — in-workspace | **hydrate** | same as `cat`; truncated by the shim |
| `ls /etc`, `cat /etc/passwd` — absolute/out-of-workspace | **passthrough** | exec real binary with original args (A3) |
| `find <dir> -exec …`, `-mtime …` — unsupported flag | **fail loud** | exit 1 with a clear error; never partial-scan (A4) |

**Path scoping (A3):** shims route ONLY workspace-relative or in-workspace paths. Absolute or
out-of-workspace paths pass straight through to the real tool — the shim never hijacks `ls /etc`.

**Fail loud (A4):** if a `find` flag (e.g. `-exec`, `-mtime`) cannot be served by the metadata
tree, the shim exits 1 with a descriptive error rather than running the predicate against the
partial cache and returning wrong results.

**Search gating (A1):** `grep` routes to the room `/search` endpoint (requires Plan 3). If the
room's search is unreachable or returns `503 search_unavailable`, the shim exits 1 — it never
scans the partial cache and silently returns empty or wrong results.

### `WorkspaceCache`

The shim maintains a per-room, content-addressed LRU cache (512 MB, 7-day idle TTL). Cache
entries are `Uint8Array` blobs keyed by normalised path and invalidated by hash mismatch:
before serving a cached entry for a `cat`/`hydrate` call, the shim checks the tree's current
`content_hash`; if it has changed, the cache entry is evicted and the blob is re-fetched. The
cache is hash-keyed, so a file moved to a new path that keeps the same content reuses the
cached bytes (cross-path dedup).

**Background prefetch (Task 18):** the daemon also warms this cache proactively — on every
consumed `file.write` entry under a path the participant can read, it fires a fire-and-forget
`WorkspaceCache` warm by the entry's `content_hash` (skipping already-warm hashes and files over
`prefetch.max_bytes`, default 5 MB). This is the one ambient byte-move D-PH3 permits: it only
ever touches this in-memory cache in `state_dir`, never the working tree, and a failed warm is
swallowed as a debug log — `prefetch.enabled: false` in `mesh.yml` turns it off entirely.

### Bulk hydration: `mesh fs hydrate`

For deliberate pre-population (e.g. before running a build):

```sh
mesh fs hydrate [<prefix>] [--into <dir>]
# e.g.: mesh fs hydrate src/ --into /tmp/workspace
```

Fetches the metadata tree for `<prefix>`, downloads each file's R2 blob, and writes it under
`<into>` (default: the workspace root, i.e. cwd). A path-containment guard skips any node whose resolved
destination would escape `<into>` (warns to stderr). Run this before a build, then build on
the real directory — the build sees hydrated files at real paths.

### MCP fs tools

The daemon MCP server exposes three fs tools for MCP-native agents:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `room_fs_ls` | List the metadata tree (or a prefix subtree); returns `[{path, size, content_hash, tip_seq}]` |
| `room_fs_search` | FTS snippet search over indexed file content (proxies to `/search`) |
| `room_fs_read` | Hydrate a single file from R2 via the workspace cache; returns bytes as base64 |

All three proxy through the daemon IPC socket — they use the same cache and room client as the
bash shim, so cache hits are shared between bash and MCP tool calls.

### S-E6 transparent build — v2 / FUSE (NOT shipped in v1)

A compiler or linter reading an un-hydrated path (e.g. `tsc` following import chains into a
cold workspace) needs FUSE-level interception or a per-language import resolver to hydrate
files on-demand. Neither is in v1.

**v1 workflow for builds:**
1. `mesh fs hydrate src/` — pre-populate the source subtree into the workspace root (default: cwd; `--root <dir>` for a scratch checkout).
2. Run the build in place — the compiler sees real files.

Full build transparency (hydrate-on-read for arbitrary compiler I/O) is the FUSE-adapter work
planned for v2. v1 is honest about this: the shim router returns `passthrough` for any path the
shim can't serve transparently, so a build that touches un-hydrated paths uses the real (local)
file system — it does not silently produce wrong results.


## Local & cross-machine demo

The room does not distinguish participants by host — two terminals with two identities and one
room URL behave exactly like two machines. You do not need to deploy for the local case;
`wrangler dev` on `localhost` is reachable from every terminal on the box.

One-shot helper (boots the room, mints identities + room, prints the per-terminal steps):

```sh
bun run demo:local
```

By hand, each participant needs its own `MESH_HOME` so identities and room tokens don't clobber
each other:

**Terminal 0 — the room**
```sh
cd packages/room && bunx wrangler dev          # http://localhost:8787
```

**Terminal 1 — human (owner)**
```sh
export MESH_HOME=~/.mesh-harry
bun run mesh -- keygen --id harry@hcproduct
bun run mesh -- create-room swarm-demo --owner harry@hcproduct --url http://localhost:8787
# prints:  invite: swarm-demo.<secret>
bun run mesh -- join http://localhost:8787/v1/rooms/swarm-demo swarm-demo.<secret>
bun run mesh -- chat                            # interactive REPL: backfill + live + prompt
```

**Terminal 2 — agent B (backend)**
```sh
export MESH_HOME=~/.mesh-agentb
bun run mesh -- keygen --id agentb@team-be
bun run mesh -- join http://localhost:8787/v1/rooms/swarm-demo swarm-demo.<secret>
```

Work the task lifecycle from here — `claim` → `inform` → `deliver` — see
[README's Task lifecycle](../README.md#4-task-lifecycle) for the full verb reference.

**Terminal 3 — agent C (reviewer)**
```sh
export MESH_HOME=~/.mesh-agentc
bun run mesh -- keygen --id agentc@team-be
bun run mesh -- join http://localhost:8787/v1/rooms/swarm-demo swarm-demo.<secret>
```

Then `accept`/`reject` the delivery from here — same reference as above.

Terminal 1's `mesh chat` shows every transition live (use `mesh log -f` for a non-interactive
stream). For role-gated verdicts, announce with `--verdict-by reviewer:backend` and grant
`agentc` that role at join — roles are filtered by the invite's `grantable_roles` (PROTOCOL §2).

**Scripted arc.** `examples/verify-scenario.ts` drives the full announce → claim → deliver →
accept arc for three tasks (+ the announcer bot) and verifies the chain against a running room:

```sh
MESH_E2E_URL=http://localhost:8787 bun examples/verify-scenario.ts
```

**True two machines.** Same flow, but the room must be reachable from both: deploy it
(`bun run deploy:room`) and use the `https://…workers.dev` base on each machine, or tunnel a dev
room (`cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8787`). Each machine runs its own keygen + join.

To wake **autonomous** agents instead of driving by hand, see the Daemon and Live agent demo
sections below.

### Shared-workspace demo

A one-command scaffold (`demo-scaffold.sh` or `bun run demo:scaffold` from a repo checkout)
boots a room, seeds the shared workspace with a buggy todo-backend, and sets up two teammates
(`fixer@build`, `reviewer@build`) with their operating contracts + `mesh.yml` + live agents.

**Scaffold flags:**

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| _(none)_ | Boot room + seed workspace + set up agents (live Claude) |
| `--simulate` | CLI-drive the entire fix with no Claude — great "see it work" path |
| `--fire` | Announce the task for you after scaffolding |
| `--no-agents` | Scaffold + seed only; no Claude sessions started |
| `--clean` | Tear down: stop agents + listeners, wipe demo state |

**The seeded fixture** (`examples/todo-backend/`): a tiny in-memory TODO API. Planted bug:
`toggle(id)` in `src/todos.ts` always sets `done = true` instead of flipping it, so a
completed todo can never be un-completed. The failing test is `toggle flips done both ways`;
the one-line fix is `todo.done = !todo.done`.

**Write policy** — applied automatically by extension; no per-file config needed:

| Extension | Policy | Behaviour |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| `.ts .js .py .go .rs .java …` | `merge` | OCC 3-way auto-merge on write; genuine overlap → `<<<<<<<` conflict markers, never silently lost |
| `.md .txt` (READMEs, plans) | `shared` | Live CRDT relay — everyone's edits merge in real time (`mesh fs edit`) |
| opt-in, any path | `exclusive` | `mesh fs lock <path>` — serialised lease for any path that needs strict serialisation |

Teammates use the `mesh fs` CLI to interact with the shared workspace:
- `mesh fs grep <q> [--prefix <p>] [--hydrate]` — server-side content search; hydrate only matched winners
- `mesh fs get <path> [--into <dir>]` — fetch a file from the workspace
- `mesh fs put <path> [--as <repopath>]` — upload + post a `file.write` entry (OCC merge-on-write for code)
- `mesh fs ls [-f]` — list the metadata tree (`-f`: live view — tree, leases w/ TTL, hydration ratio)
- `mesh fs edit <path>` — live CRDT session for prose files
- `mesh fs lock / unlock <path>` — acquire / release an exclusive lease

For the cross-machine case, run the scaffold on machine 2, share the room URL + invite with
machine 1 out-of-band, then `mesh join` on machine 1. After `fixer@build` does `mesh fs put
src/todos.ts` on machine 2, the human on machine 1 runs `mesh fs get src/todos.ts` and sees
the fixed file immediately — one shared workspace across machines, no tarball.

## Daemon (`meshl`)

The `meshl` daemon runs one instance per agent per room. It long-polls the room,
filters events via T0 subscriptions, and wakes the agent process via tmux injection,
MCP polling hints, or both (hybrid).

### Standing vs. dynamic interests: the unified watch model (W6)

Three independent mechanisms feed the same wake pipeline, and all of them wake the
agent — none is a fallback for another:

- **Static (`mesh.yml` `subscriptions.*`)** — standing interests declared once at
  daemon startup: mentions, threads, performative types, roles, and any
  `subscriptions.watches` predicates. Evaluated locally by the daemon's T0 filter
  against every entry it streams.
- **Dynamic (room-registered watches, `POST /watches`)** — per-session interests
  registered on the room itself via `mesh watch entry [--path <p>] [--participant <id>]`
  or auto-registered by the CLI (see below). The room evaluates these server-side and
  pushes a `notify` frame (WS) or a `notifies[]` entry (poll) directly to the owner —
  told, not polled, even for a path the daemon's static config never mentioned.
- **Derived (zero-config, Intent M / T13)** — a third interest class the daemon computes
  FOR the agent from what the room already knows about it, refreshed from the duty loop's
  standing `GET /state` poll each cycle (no new traffic): a `decide.request` naming the
  agent (by id or by an owner-BOUND role), a `deliver` awaiting the agent's verdict, an
  `escalate` whose `data.to` targets it, the batched sync-conflict `inform` touching a
  path it holds a lease/session on, and a `stuck`/`gone` `signal` from a participant one
  of its held claims `depends_on`. Default ON; opt out with `attention.derived: false` in
  `mesh.yml`. Staleness bound: one duty cadence (the nudge loop is the backstop). Role
  authority here comes ONLY from `/state`'s `bindings[]` (owner-issued, in-window) — a
  self-declared card role never wakes anyone, exactly as it never authorizes anything
  (see Authority posture above).

A `notify`/`notifies[]` hit bypasses the T0 static filter entirely: an explicit
room-registered watch on a path or participant IS the subscription, so the daemon
fetches the referenced entry and feeds it straight to the wake pipeline (T1 gate →
debounce → digest). If the same entry also happens to match T0 independently, the
daemon dedups so it wakes exactly once, not twice.

**Auto-subscribe on lock/edit/423** — `fs lock <path>` and `fs edit <path>` register
a perf-less `{kind:"entry", path}` watch on successful lock/session-start, so a later
`file.unlock` or `system.lease_clear` (lease expiry) on that path tells the holder's
own daemon. `fs unlock` and a clean `fs edit` session end delete that watch again
(bounded growth beats the rare hand-registered collision). If `fs lock` is rejected
with `423 path_locked`, the rejected caller is ALSO auto-subscribed to the same path
before the command exits — so they're told, not left to poll, the moment the path
frees. Watch registration failures (e.g. the 64-watches-per-participant cap) never
fail the surrounding fs operation; they print a visible warning instead.

### Durable wake delivery and listener status

For `tmux` and `hybrid` wake delivery, a digest that cannot be injected because
the pane is busy or gone is saved before the wake cursor advances. The daemon
writes `state_dir/pending_wake.json` with this shape:

```json
{"digest":"[mesh] 3 relevant events through seq 142","through_seq":142,"ts":1784160000000}
```

`digest` is the text awaiting injection, `through_seq` is the last room
sequence covered by that digest, and `ts` is the Unix timestamp in milliseconds
when it was deferred. The file survives daemon restarts. It is cleared after
that digest is injected successfully, or after a later wake is delivered and
therefore supersedes it. Clearing is sequence-guarded, so an older retry cannot
delete a newer pending wake.

The listener checks for a pending record at the `wake.tmux.busy_retry_s`
cadence (default 10 seconds). When the file is absent, each tick stops after the
local file check and does not probe or capture the tmux pane, so the retry loop
has zero tmux cost while empty. When a record exists, the listener probes the
pane and retries delivery at the next observed idle boundary; a busy or gone
pane leaves the record in place for the next tick.

`meshl status` reports the wake pipeline with these fields:

| field | meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `room` | Configured room id. |
| `wake_cursor` | Last batch handed to the wake pipeline. |
| `unwoken_log_gap` | Room head minus `wake_cursor`; includes entries your subscriptions never matched, so it is **not delivery lag**. |
| `pending_wake` | `none`, or `yes — through seq N, deferred Ns ago (retries at next idle)` for the durable deferred digest. |
| `hook_state` | Latest agent hook state and its age, or the scrape-fallback reason when no usable hook state exists. |
| `probe` | Current effective pane state: `idle`, `busy`, `gone`, or an error/`n/a` result. |
| `state_dir` | Local directory containing listener state, including the cursor and any pending wake. |

### Configuration (`mesh.yml`)

Required fields:

| key | type | description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `identity.id` | string | Participant ID (`name@team`) |
| `identity.key` | string | Path to the identity JSON file from `mesh keygen` |

| `subscriptions.watches` | Extra watch predicates to register at startup |
| `wake.tmux.pane` | tmux target-pane (required for tmux and hybrid backends) |
| `wake.tmux.adapter` | CLI adapter identifier (omp, claude, codex) |
| `wake.tmux.busy_retry_s` | Retry interval when the pane is busy and cadence for pending-wake checks — default `10` s |
| `wake.tmux.max_busy_wait_s` | Give up after this many seconds if always busy |
| `wake.mcp.poll_hint_interval_s` | Hybrid: inject a nudge if inbox non-empty and agent hasn't polled (default 900 s) |
| `wake.escalation.mentions` | Hybrid: inject on @-mentions (true/false) |
| `wake.escalation.performatives` | Hybrid: inject on these performative types |
| `wake.escalation.watches` | Hybrid: inject on watch-match entries |
| `wake.hook_busy_stale_s` | Seconds a `meshl hooks`-written `busy` state is trusted before probing falls back to pane-scraping — default `900` |
| `wake.duty_poll_interval_s` | Seconds between duty-reconciler `/state` polls, see [Duty reconciler](#duty-reconciler) below — default `60`; `0` disables |
| `gate.enabled` | Enable the T1 attention gate — default `false`. **Currently a validated no-op stub:** survivors pass through unfiltered even when `true` (the LLM call is not yet implemented) |
| `gate.endpoint` | LLM endpoint URL for the gate (no effect while the stub is a no-op) |
| `gate.model` | Model identifier for the gate (no effect while the stub is a no-op) |
| `gate.prompt_file` | Path to the gate's prompt template (no effect while the stub is a no-op) |
| `liveness.publish` | Consent switch for observable liveness (Intent F) — publish `signal` condition transitions at all (default `true`) |
| `liveness.interval_s` | Liveness tick interval (default `300`; does NOT inherit `heartbeat.interval_s` — S-F2) |

| `liveness.debounce_s` | Minimum gap between published transitions (default `60`) |
| `consume.failure_threshold` | Consecutive WS/poll consume-pipe failures (T11, Intent L S-L7) before the daemon logs a pipe-dead line and marks itself `degraded` locally — default `3` |
| `brief.arrival_pointer` | Inject the Intent I arrival pointer at all (first wake / reanchor gap / `poke --brief`) — default `true` |
| `brief.reanchor_after_s` | Seconds since the last wake before the NEXT wake re-anchors with the pointer instead of its digest — default `3600`; `0` disables |
| `workspace.root` | Local checkout `WorksetScanner` (Task 15) scans for tree-diff awareness — default `.` (the daemon's cwd at `meshl run` time) |
| `workset.enabled` | Run the ambient tree-diff scan at all — default `true` |
| `workset.interval_s` | Seconds between `WorksetScanner` `/tree` scans, see [Ambient tree-diff scan](#ambient-tree-diff-scan-worksetscanner) below — default `15`; floors at `5` |
| `attention.derived` | Zero-config derived attention (Intent M, Task 13) — wake from what the room already knows about the agent (verdict-due, addressed escalate, held-lease conflict, `depends_on` stuck signal), see [Attention (WAKE) sources](#attention-wake-sources) above — default `true` |
| `prefetch.enabled` | Background `WorkspaceCache` warming on consumed `file.write` entries (Task 18), see [`WorkspaceCache`](#workspacecache) above — default `true` |
| `prefetch.max_bytes` | Skip warming files over this size — default `5000000` (5 MB) |

### Duty reconciler

Event wakes fire once, on the triggering entry — an agent that's busy, joins late, or loses a
claim race never re-learns about work that becomes actionable *later*: an open task nobody
re-announces, a delivery awaiting its verdict, or its own claimed task whose dependency just
completed. `daemon/src/duties.ts` closes that gap: every `wake.duty_poll_interval_s` seconds
(default `60`; `0` disables) it re-reads `/state` and, if the actionable set changed since the
last poll, injects a digest — e.g. `[mesh] duties — awaiting your verdict (accept/reject): <ref>
· open to claim: <ref>. Run \`mesh inbox\`/\`mesh state\`, then claim/deliver/accept.` — a pull
over current room state, robust to any missed or unsubscribed event.

### Ambient tree-diff scan (`WorksetScanner`)

Alongside the duty reconciler, `daemon/src/workset.ts`'s `WorksetScanner` polls `GET /tree`
every `workset.interval_s` (default `15`s, floors at `5`s — deliberately decoupled from
`wake.duty_poll_interval_s`) and classifies every room-tracked path against the local
checkout at `workspace.root` (default: the daemon's cwd) and its `fs edit`/`put`/`get`
sidecar, via the same `classifySync` `fs status` uses. It computes two ambient counts —
`behind` (the room moved past an untouched local copy) and `conflict` (an unreconciled
diverged/never-synced pair) — for the CHECK-tier badge (Task 16) to surface in wake
digests, duty nudges, `inbox`, and `brief`. IO discipline: a local file is re-hashed only
when its mtime/size changed since the last scan, and the scan itself never fetches an
artifact/content endpoint or writes under the workspace root — metadata only (S-M4). A
room with no local sync history yet (no `edit-base` dir) is skipped cleanly and logged
once, never as an error loop.

### Observable liveness (`signal`, Intent F)

While a task is `CLAIMED`, the daemon's `LivenessMonitor` periodically re-runs the same
`Injector.probe()` the wake gate and `Heartbeater` already use, and — on a `working`↔`stuck`↔`gone`
**transition** only, never per-tick — publishes a `signal` entry (`data:{condition}`). `signal` is
inform-like: it never transitions the claim machine and never renews a lease (PROTOCOL §3). `mesh
state` / `room_roster` show the fold as `cond`/`cond@seq` columns; `condition` reads `-` (null)
unless the participant currently holds a CLAIMED task, even if it published a condition earlier
(claim-gated read, S-F6 — a released participant is never reported stuck). `escalate(stalled)` /
`escalate(lease_expired)` cite the holder's last published condition when one exists. Subscribe to a
peer's transitions with `mesh watch entry --participant <id>`.

**Pipe error visibility + honest staleness (T11/T12, Intent L S-L7).** A participant whose
consume pipe (WS + poll fallback) dies silently must not read as present-and-working forever.
T11: `Consumer` counts consecutive WS/poll failures per branch and, at
`consume.failure_threshold`, logs once and marks itself `degraded`; the next success of that
SAME branch restores `ok` and (when `liveness.publish` is on) republishes a fresh
`signal(working)` so the roster recovers promptly. But a truly dead pipe can't publish anything
— that's what T12 covers: the room additionally folds `condition_ts` (the signal entry's
wall-clock, additive, alongside `condition`/`condition_seq`, same claim-gated read at `/state`)
and CLI renders (`mesh state`, `mesh fs roles`) annotate a condition older than 3×
`liveness.stuck_after_s` (900s) as `<condition>? stale <age>` — e.g. `working? stale 22m`. The
room never judges staleness; only the views do.

**Consent (sovereignty).** `liveness.publish` defaults **ON** — set it to `false` in `mesh.yml` to
opt a runtime out entirely; the room's derived floor (lease expiry, `escalate(stalled)`,
`last_seen_seq`) still protects the room whether or not a given daemon publishes.

**Two cadence guards (S-F2 — surfaced before the lease dies, not instead of it).**
`meshl run`/`meshl validate` warn at startup when `liveness.debounce_s >= liveness.stuck_after_s`
(a transition could be suppressed before it's ever published). At runtime, `LivenessMonitor` warns
**once** per process lifetime when `liveness.interval_s + liveness.stuck_after_s +
liveness.debounce_s >= <room lease_ttl_s>` — past that latency budget a `stuck` signal can't
possibly surface before the claim's own lease would have expired anyway, defeating the point.

**MCP-only quality note.** On `wake.backend: mcp` the daemon has no tmux pane to probe — its
`LivenessMonitor` runs against a no-op injector whose `probe()` always reports `idle`. Conditions
published there are **append-freshness-based only** (`working` while the agent keeps posting/
claiming within `stuck_after_s`, else `stuck`); `gone` is **never** daemon-published on this
backend — an MCP-only agent's actual death still surfaces only through the room-derived floor
(lease expiry). This is the same asymmetry the `tmux`/`hybrid` backends' real pane probe closes;
it is a known MCP-only limitation, not a bug.

### Briefing plane (`mesh brief` / `room_brief`, Intent I)

`mesh brief` (CLI) and `room_brief` (MCP tool) compose the SAME shared read: the room's
standing charter (`charter/room.md`), your bound seat's contract(s) (`charter/roles/<role>.md`),
and your current situation (open-to-claim, awaiting-your-verdict, dependencies-ready duties via
the shared `@mesh/proto` classifier, plus open decisions where you are a named settler). Roles
ALWAYS come from the room's `GET /roles` binding-resolution view (in-window bindings only) —
never the roster's join-time card cohort and never a daemon's local `subscriptions.roles`.
Charters are ordinary `shared`-policy file-plane content — `mesh fs put charter/room.md` /
`charter/roles/<role>.md` to author or amend one; every edit is a signed `file.write` entry,
attributed in the brief by seq + signed sender (S-I3). A room with no stated charter still
returns a full brief — `content`/`tip_seq`/`author: null` per charter section, never an error
(R-I1). Charters INFORM, never compel: nothing in a charter's text is parsed or consulted by any
authorization check (R-I2) — verdicts, grants, and decisions flow only through the room's
existing authorities, exactly as if no charter existed.

**Arrival pointer.** The daemon injects a one-line pointer — never the charter body — at three
moments: (a) the first wake ever for this identity + `state_dir` (neither a wake cursor nor a
wake stamp exists yet), (b) a wake delivered after a gap of at least `brief.reanchor_after_s`
since the previous wake (the pointer REPLACES that wake's digest — or a duty nudge's line — since
the injector's `inject(line)` contract is one line/one Enter; `mesh inbox` still carries the
digest's detail on the next pull), and (c) `meshl poke --brief` (an explicit operator request).
A successful injection always stamps `last_wake.json` — including the first-wake pointer itself,
so a crash-looping daemon does not re-announce itself on every restart. Guidance-CHANGE wakes
ride the existing `charter/` path watch machinery (`mesh watch entry --path charter/room.md`) —
no new subscription kind.

**Config (`mesh.yml` `brief:`, optional).** `arrival_pointer` (default `true`) is the owner's
consent switch — set `false` to silence pointer injection entirely (sovereignty; the room's
derived floor is unaffected). `reanchor_after_s` (default `3600`; `0` disables re-anchoring)
tunes how long an absence must be before the next wake re-anchors instead of just delivering its
digest.

#### How to give your room a charter

End state: every arrival — human or agent — runs one command and knows the room's mission,
its own seat's contract, and what needs it right now.

Prerequisites: you are the room owner (steps 1–3; step 4 works for anyone), and the target
participants are joined.

1. Write the room charter locally, then publish it to the well-known path:

   ```sh
   $EDITOR room-charter.md          # mission, working agreements, how to signal
   mesh fs put room-charter.md --as charter/room.md
   # entry appended: file.write charter/room.md (signed, attributable)
   ```

2. Write a seat contract per role and publish it under `charter/roles/`:

   ```sh
   $EDITOR reviewer-contract.md     # what this seat owns, its verdict policy, its cadence
   mesh fs put reviewer-contract.md --as charter/roles/reviewer.md
   ```

3. Bind who fills the seat — the brief resolves seats from the Intent G role-binding view
   (`GET /roles`, in-window only), so an unbound contract is unreachable no matter what it says:

   ```sh
   mesh fs role dana@team reviewer
   mesh fs roles                    # confirm: dana@team holds reviewer, in-window
   ```

4. Verify as a participant:

   ```sh
   mesh brief
   # who i am: dana@team in swarm-myproject (roles: reviewer)
   # room charter:
   #   # charter/room.md — seq <n> by <owner-id>
   #   <charter body>
   # my seats:
   #   # charter/roles/reviewer.md — seq <n> by <owner-id>
   #   <seat contract body>
   # situation:
   #   awaiting your verdict (accept/reject): <task-refs>
   #   dependencies delivered — proceed/deliver: <task-refs>
   #   open to claim: <task-refs>
   #   open decisions awaiting your input: <id> (<question>)
   ```

   MCP-hosted agents get the same read via the `room_brief` tool (`{role?}` narrows to one
   seat). Daemon-driven agents are pointed at it automatically — see "Arrival pointer" above.

5. Amend anytime: re-run the same `mesh fs put … --as charter/…` — the brief always reads the
   tip, and participants watching the path (`mesh watch entry --path charter/room.md`) are
   woken through the existing notification machinery.

Troubleshooting:

- **A seat section is missing from someone's brief** → they hold no in-window binding for that
  role. Run `mesh fs roles` and check the `window` range — a time-boxed-out binding does not
  surface the seat (bench `depth` does not matter here: any in-window binding, starter or
  bench, surfaces it). Roster "roles" (the join-time card cohort) grant nothing here.
- **`no charter yet — owner can \`mesh fs put charter/room.md\`** → expected in a charter-less
  room (R-I1): the brief still reports the live situation; only the guidance sections are empty.
- **A charter says "X may accept" but X's accept is rejected** → working as designed (R-I2):
  charters inform, never compel — verdict authority still flows only from `--verdict-by` /
  role bindings.

### Validate before running

```sh
meshl validate --config mesh.yml
```

Checks: identity key readable, room token in `~/.mesh/rooms.json`, room reachable at
`/healthz`, tmux pane probe (tmux backend only), watches registrable.

Exit code 1 if any check fails; each failure is printed to stderr as `FAIL  <description>`.

### Run

```sh
meshl run --config mesh.yml
```

The daemon opens a unix socket at `state_dir/daemon.sock`. On SIGINT or SIGTERM it stops
the consumer and heartbeater cleanly.

### Status

```sh
meshl status --config mesh.yml
# room:            swarm-myproject
# wake_cursor:     142   (last batch handed to the wake pipeline)
# unwoken_log_gap: 3   (room head − wake_cursor; includes entries your subscriptions never matched — NOT delivery lag)
# pending_wake:    none
# hook_state:      idle (age 4s)
# probe:           idle
# state_dir:       /home/user/.mesh/state/agentB
```

- `wake_cursor` — last seq the daemon processed; stored in `state_dir/wake_cursor.json`
- `unwoken_log_gap` — room head − wake cursor; counts entries the daemon's subscriptions
  never matched, so it is **not** delivery lag
- `pending_wake` — the durable deferred digest (see "Durable wake delivery and listener
  status" above), or `none`
- `probe` — tmux pane state (`idle`, `busy`, `gone`; `n/a` for non-tmux backends)

### MCP shim

```sh
meshl mcp --state-dir <state_dir>
```

Runs the stdio MCP server, bridging the agent host to the daemon's unix socket. The
MCP shim is stateless — it forwards JSON-RPC calls to the socket and returns results.
If the socket is absent (daemon not running), every MCP tool returns a structured
`{error: "daemon_not_running", ...}` result rather than throwing.

Wire to Claude Code:

```sh
claude mcp add mesh -- meshl mcp --state-dir ~/.mesh/state/agentB
```

### State directory layout

```
state_dir/
  daemon.sock        # unix socket for IPC (MCP shim + CLI inbox)
  wake_cursor.json   # {"seq": N} — last processed entry
```

The unix socket is removed and recreated on each `meshl run`. The wake cursor persists
across restarts; delete it to replay the full log on the next run.

Logs from the daemon go to stdout/stderr of the `meshl run` process. Redirect as needed:

```sh
meshl run --config mesh.yml >> ~/.mesh/state/agentB/daemon.log 2>&1 &
```

## Live agent demo

`scripts/live-demo.sh` is the end-to-end proof that agents *actively participate*: a human
posts one sentence and two real agents coordinate to satisfy it, with no scripted decisions.
It is the fastest way to demonstrate the whole stack on one machine.

### What it stands up

```
human (you)          posts "I need a homepage" (a request) via the mesh CLI
hermes@router        live Claude in tmux pane meshlive:0.0, woken by its daemon on `request`
                     → reads the request, runs `mesh announce homepage --verdict-by <you>`
webby@frontend       live Claude in tmux pane meshlive:0.1, woken by its daemon on `announce`
                     → `mesh claim homepage` → builds index.html → `mesh deliver … --artifact git:homepage@<sha>`
you                  `mesh accept homepage` → DONE
```

Each agent is a normal interactive `claude` session in a tmux pane. Each has its own `meshl`
daemon (tmux wake backend) that T0-filters the room stream and injects a one-line `[mesh]`
wake into the agent's pane. Each agent's behaviour comes entirely from its operating contract
(`examples/agent-prompts/router.md` and `frontend.md`), copied into the agent's working
directory as `CLAUDE.md`.

### Prerequisites

- `claude` installed and **logged in** (Claude Max or API). The agents reason with it.
- `tmux` and `bun` on `PATH`.
- No room to deploy — the script boots `wrangler dev` locally if `:8787` is not already up.

### Run it

```sh
# from the mesh/ repo root
bun run demo:live                # or: bash scripts/live-demo.sh
tmux attach -t meshlive          # optional: pane 0 router, pane 1 worker, pane 2 room log

# the whole demo is one sentence (or pass --fire to have the script post it):
MESH_HOME=~/.mesh-live/harry mesh post "I need a homepage"

# you are the verdict authority (the router announces with --verdict-by you):
MESH_HOME=~/.mesh-live/harry mesh accept homepage --body "ship it"

bash scripts/live-demo.sh --clean   # stop agents + daemons, wipe ~/.mesh-live
```

`mesh` here is the repo CLI; if you have not built the binary, use
`MESH_HOME=~/.mesh-live/harry bun packages/cli/src/main.ts post "I need a homepage"`.

### Proof the trigger is real (not the script poking the agent)

Between an idle agent pane and its `claim`, the only thing that touches the worker's terminal
is the daemon. Watch for the injected line in the worker pane (`tmux capture-pane -p -t meshlive:0.1`):

```
❯ [mesh] 1 event in <room>: announce(homepage). Run `mesh inbox` for detail; act via mesh claim/deliver/post.
⏺ Bash(mesh inbox --mark)
⏺ Bash(mesh claim homepage)
⏺ Bash(mesh deliver homepage --artifact git:homepage@<sha> …)
```

That digest is `buildDigest()` output delivered by `TmuxInjector.inject` (`tmux send-keys`).
The server-side `mesh log` (independent of any terminal) shows the matching
`request → announce → claim → deliver → accept` chain.

### Customising

The script generates a `mesh.yml` per agent under `~/.mesh-live/<name>.yml`. To use a
different runtime, change `wake.tmux.adapter` (`claude` → `omp`/`codex`) and the launch binary
in `~/.mesh-live/launch-<name>.sh`. To prove "don't care how many are listening", add a second
worker pane + daemon with the same `frontend.md` contract — the claim is a compare-and-set,
so exactly one wins and the rest get `claim_conflict`.

### Troubleshooting

| symptom | cause / fix |
|---|---|
| agent pane shows `Not logged in` or `node: command not found` | the tmux pane started with a minimal `PATH`; the launcher sets a full one — ensure `claude`/`node`/`bun` resolve in your login shell |
| daemon never injects | pane is busy or not idle-detectable; `meshl status --config ~/.mesh-live/webby.yml` shows `probe:` — must be `idle`. Claude idle = empty `❯` prompt, busy = `esc to interrupt` footer |
| `accept` → `not_authorized_verdict` | the announce did not name you as verdict holder; the router contract uses `--verdict-by <requester>`, so post the request as the same id you accept with |
| agent stalls at the folder-trust prompt | the script sends Enter to accept it after launch; if your `claude` build differs, accept it once manually in the pane |
| daemon detects `busy` unreliably (screen-scraping the pane is fragile) | wire `meshl hooks --runtime claude\|omp --state-dir <dir>` into the agent's idle/busy hooks — the robust wake signal, not a pane-scrape guess |
| you know there's work but don't want to wait for the next digest | `meshl poke --config <path>` force-injects an inbox hint immediately, bypassing the idle/busy gate |

## Health check (`mesh doctor`)

`mesh doctor [--porcelain] [--root <dir>]` (Intent L, S-L6 "any member, in one step,
obtains the room's open problems") composes ONE read-only pass over everything already
worth knowing about a room, client-side, over EXISTING endpoints — no new room route.
It checks: open escalations (with a `mesh ack <seq>` hint), stalled holds (any claim
`CLAIMED` past its `max_claim_until` — a steward view, not just your own holds), lapsed
decisions and open decisions past their deadline, roster conditions that are stale (the
T12 rule) or `gone`, local workspace conflicts (`fs status`'s `diverged` rows and its
porcelain "C" conflict-markers family — drift like `behind`/`ahead` is not a conflict),
the room's hash chain (`GET /verify`), and the R2 artifacts of the 10 most-recently
delivered claims (a `HEAD` per `r2:` hash — missing ones get a re-deliver hint).

Every check degrades independently: a network blip on `verify`, a discover-gated `/tree`,
an unreachable `/entries` page, or one flaky artifact `HEAD` each turn into a `⚠ ...:
skipped (<reason>)` line instead of failing the command — `doctor` always finishes and
reports what it *could* verify. The one hard-fail path is `/state` itself: no state, no
report, exit 2. Otherwise: **exit 0** clean, **exit 1** problems found (same D5 contract
`fs put`/`fs get` use). `--porcelain` prints one stable `KIND\tref\tdetail` line per
problem — nothing on a clean room — for scripting; the default view groups rows under a
titled block per non-empty category.

## Security model & v1 limitations

mesh's integrity rests on signatures + the hash chain: every entry is Ed25519-signed by
its author, the room binds each `id` to one pubkey at join, and the bearer identity is bound
to `sub.sender` and `sub.room` on append (no cross-room/cross-identity replay). Verification
is a library call, not a CLI command: `verifySubmission` (`@mesh/proto`) re-derives and checks
an entry's signature against the hash chain — the same check the room runs on append,
exercised end-to-end by `examples/verify-scenario.ts`.
Within those guarantees, operators should know:

- **Room ids must be unguessable.** `POST /create` is unauthenticated and first-caller-wins
  (the DO is addressed by `idFromName(roomId)`). Anyone who creates an id before you owns it.
  Use random/namespaced room ids and create them at provisioning time, not predictable names.
- **The invite secret is the trust boundary.** Holding it lets a participant join, and with the
  default `grantable_roles: ["*"]` it lets them self-assign any role (including verdict roles).
  Pass an explicit `grantable_roles` list to `create-room` to scope what roles an invite can grant.
  Treat the invite like a shared secret; rotate with `mesh room invite --rotate`.
- **Passphrase invites trade entropy for relayability — mind their guards.** A phrase admits
  whoever presents the matching participant id + phrase first, so share it out-of-band with the
  intended agent only. Safety comes from the guards (single-use, id-scoped, 5-attempt burn,
  TTL); don't extend `--ttl` beyond what the handoff needs, and `--revoke` anything unused.
- **Identity files are local secrets.** `~/.mesh/identity.json` (private key) and `rooms.json`
  (bearer tokens) are written `0600` in a `0700` home; the daemon IPC socket is `0600` in a
  `0700` state dir. Do not loosen these on shared hosts.
- **Submission size is capped** at 64 KB; **roster** at 512 participants/room; **watches** at 64
  per participant; announce durations (`lease_ttl_s`/`max_claim_s`/`claim_window_s`) must be
  integers in `[1, 2592000]`. These bound how fast one participant can grow the DO (1 GB ceiling).
- **A holder can hold a claim indefinitely** by heartbeating or posting progress (lease
  auto-renews). `max_claim_s` raises `escalate(stalled)` but does not auto-release (D5) — the
  owner force-releases. Watch for stalled holds.
- **Known follow-ups (v1.1):** `card_sig` is not yet verified at join (impact bounded by the
  id↔pubkey binding + role scoping); WS connections and full-log replay per connect are not
  capped; `/create`, `/join`, and `/watches` are not yet rate-limited (roster/watch caps bound
  the durable damage); the in-memory rate limiter resets on DO hibernation. `task_ref` announce
  is open (any member can announce any ref first).
